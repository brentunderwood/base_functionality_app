This project works successfully when run in android studio. However, Android Studio is unable to build the APK or Bundle files because the native code is not neon-compatible. The goal is to fix this without changing any of the functionality. When hitting the button on the spash page, a list of legal moves from the starting position is printed to the log. You can use this to confirm everything is still working after your changes.
